My life do not contain anything that is engineering or coding related. One of the reason that I decided to start blogging on Github is quite simple and also understandable. Just to play cool. And it is free plus open sourced. There is one thing that I am sure about is that I will try my best to make my audiences think I am a really cool person and attract them. To do that, I need to offer something solid and useful to my audiences, even if at that stage, my only audience is my dog.</h2>

I research on early vertebrate palaeontology, yes, by that I mean 3D preserved awesome-looking died fossil fish. I used micro-CT scanner to get whatever information I can get from my specimen and studied it using other softwares. After that, things will get very complicated and I do not want to end up my first blog on that sort of thing. So that is it.</h2>
