A post about what kind of skills you can get, not matter whether you enjoying or struggling, on your PhD journey.

This types of topic is probably not off your interests. Same as employers from the non-academic background, they will not have a clue about what does a PhD means and different sort of skills that comes along with the completion of the degree. 

That means that you will need to know your armours and get prepared for your next job, whether as a Post-doc somewhere fancy with lots of pressure or a consultant in a world-class company so you can enjoy your weekend with your family members. It is now the time to think about this question and when the right time comes you can be more confident and relaxed. 

Basically, most of the skills can be grouped into two types: generic and specialised. Generic skills, which applies to everyone, for example, communication skills, problem solving, teamworking, manage conflicts and organize your research and life in a balanced way. Specialised skills can be discipline specific or relate to your research degree only. For instance, my research related skills including micro-CT scanning using different scanners, operate 3D printer and produce printouts, 3D visualization using Drishti (open sourced software), and phylogenetic analysis using TNT etc. Whereas during my candidature, I learned to develop hypothesis, design my research, communicate with peers in international conferences/ workshops/meetups and engage with the public though social plus the mass media. Since I am still at my first year, there are always more to be learned and developed, but that does not stop me from thinking about what skills can I get out from the end of my PhD degree. 

To help you think about your set of skills though your degree and get prepared for your next move. The easiest approach is just to start thinking about a recent task that you completed and figure out what sort of skills you used to make it happen. 
After that, you may find yourself ends up with far more skills than I do. There is no harm to try to understand yourself better and in that way, you can start to plan your new skills. You will need to think about it anyway, at some stage, on the way to become a real researcher. So, let us research on ourselves as a starting point, and most importantly, to make a better living so that I can have more time with my dog.
